# flame-detector-simulation
A conceptual simulation of a fire detection system using Arduino Uno, MQ-135 gas sensor, KY-026 infrared flame sensor, and an LED indicator. The system identifies fire hazards based on COâ‚‚ concentration and infrared radiation, and responds via conditional logic programmed in Arduino IDE.
